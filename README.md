# ActionFunder interview

This is an interview exercise for ActionFunder, it involves displaying cards with information stored in src/testFunds.json. There should be an option to sort them by name and value. All relevant tests should be written. I have only written unit tests as e2e tests would not test anything new with this small app. The tests have been written using React testing library as it is installed alongside React. I have not used this tool before this exercise, however have managed to write some tests to ensure the functionality is working as intended

The CSS written is very basic and could be expanded on, however as this was such a short exercise I did not feel it was necessary.

In order to run the app use the commant `npm start`

In order to run the tests use the command `npm test`
